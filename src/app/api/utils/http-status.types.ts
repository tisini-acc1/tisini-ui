	| 410 // Gone - Indicates that the requested resource is no longer available at the server and no forwarding address is known
	| 411 // Length Required - The server requires the request to be valid and non-empty Content-Length header to be present
	| 412 // Precondition Failed - The server does not meet one of the preconditions that the requester put on the request
	| 413 // Payload Too Large - The server will not accept the request, because the request entity is too large
	| 414 // URI Too Long - The server will not accept the request, because the URL is too long

	| 421 // Misdirected Request - The request was directed at a server that is not able to produce a response
	| 422 // Unprocessable Entity - The request was well-formed but was unable to be followed due to semantic errors
	| 423 // Locked - The resource that is being accessed is locked
	| 424 // Failed Dependency - The request failed because it depended on another request and that request failed
	| 426 // Upgrade Required - The client should switch to a different protocol such as TLS/1.0, given in the Upgrade header field

	| 429 // Too Many Requests - The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time

	| 500 // Internal Server Error - A generic error message, given when an unexpected condition was encountered and no more specific message is suitable
	| 501 // Not Implemented - The server either does not recognize the request method, or it lacks the ability to fulfill the request
